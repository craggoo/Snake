Snake Game

You can use the arrow keys to move or the the classic gamer keys (a,s,d,w)

There are three different colored tiles. Red moves you 5 spaces, green moves you 3 spaces, and yellow moves you one space.

The speed will keep increasing as your level progresses

These are the features that currently exist. I plan to add the following features:

1) special tiles that will increase/decrease the speed
2) special tiles that will add/remove a random amount of tiles from the board
3) a special tile which will reset the speed to the initial speed
4) a special message which will be revealed as you progress through the game
